# Safe Bike Routes

Safe Bike Routes is a community project to document the ways to get around Los
Angeles by bike with as little risk as possible. The only reason this project
exists, is because of the abject failure of Los Angeles and other unincorporated
cities in the area to treat people on bicycles as human beings worthy of a life
of dignity. The status quo is not okay, and we should all raise our voices for a
better Los Angeles. Until then though, we hope this map helps you make the most
of life on two wheels in this city.

## Local Development
